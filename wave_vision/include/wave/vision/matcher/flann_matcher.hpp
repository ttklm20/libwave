/** There are several methods available in OpenCV to perform matching using
 *  FLANN. Currently, only the KDTree, KMeans, and Composite algorithms have
 *  been implemented. TODO: Add the remaining algorithms (Autotuned,
 *  Heirarchical Clustering, etc.).
 *
 *  KDTree: The default method. This uses parallel kd-trees to separate
 *  keypoint descriptors, and  can then search the tree in order to determine
 *  the closest match.
 *
 *  KMeans: This method uses k-means clustering to sort the descriptors. The
 *  clusters are recursively optimized for a set number of iterations.
 *
 *  Composite: This method combines the above two methods, and aims to determine
 *  the optimum match between the two.
 *
 *  LSH: Locality-Senstive hashing (LSH) uses hash functions to distribute the
 *  descriptors into similar buckets. The speed of hash tables allows for
 *  candidate matches to be generated very quickly. This was proposed by [Lv et.
 *  al (2007)][LSH].
 *
 *  These brief descriptions were adapted from Kaehler and Bradski's book
 *  "Learning OpenCV 3: Computer Vision in C++ with the OpenCV Library". For
 *  further reference on the different methods, please refer to pages 575-580.
